## Hi there 🙋🏽‍♀️

- Lead software engineer at <a href="https://nubank.com.br/en/">Nubank</a>.
- I work with mobile development for ~ 10 years, standing out with 🍎 iOS (mostly Swift).

```swift
let lina: [String: Any] = ["pronouns": "she-her",
                           "code": ["Swift", "Objective-C", "Kotlin", "Flutter", "Clojure"],
                           "currentFocus": "learning backend with Clojure"]
